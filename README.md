# Newcastle Nine! source code

**This is the code for the digital poem 'Newcastle Nine!'. The interface presents the user with a map of central Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, with nine location markers. Selecting each marker adds another to the poem on the right hand side of the screen.**



### Content

This code repository contains the files for the poem interface, including the audio files for each individual line in the 'sound' folder. 

The lines of the poem are stored within the 'map locations' object in the JS file 'js/lines.js', in the js/index.js file.

The interface's functionality is signposted by comments in the 'index.html' and 'js/index.js' files.

The code and design in this interface are adapted from the mobile applications Steps in Time, which I developed for the 2017 Newcastle Poetry Festival.
